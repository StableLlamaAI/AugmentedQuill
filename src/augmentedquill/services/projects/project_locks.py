"""Defines the project file locking unit so this responsibility stays isolated, testable, and easy to evolve.

Purpose: Provide per-project asyncio write locks to prevent concurrent writes
from corrupting project files.  Each project directory gets one dedicated
``asyncio.Lock``.  The registry is protected by a plain ``threading.Lock``
so it can be safely populated from any thread that creates new projects.
