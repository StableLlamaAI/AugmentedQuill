# The AI Chat Assistant

The AI Chat Assistant is your dedicated co-writer, sounding board, and editor. It sits in the right sidebar alongside your writing interface, ready to help whenever you get stuck.

The Chat Assistant is powered by the **CHAT model**, which is indicated by the **Blue** color hint throughout the application.

## How to Use the Chat

You can talk to the AI just like you would a human collaborator. Because it has access to your [Story Metadata](writing_interface.md#story-metadata), [Chapters](writing_interface.md), and [Sourcebook](sourcebook.md), it understands the context of your questions.

### Brainstorming

Stuck on a plot point? Ask the AI for ideas.
_Example:_ "I need a reason for my protagonist to leave their hometown. What are some inciting incidents that fit a fantasy setting?"

### Overcoming Writer's Block

Not sure how to start a scene?
_Example:_ "Write an opening paragraph for Chapter 3, where Sarah discovers the hidden letter. Make the tone suspenseful."

### Fact-Checking Your Own World

Forget a detail you established earlier?
_Example:_ "What color are the uniforms of the Royal Guard?" (The AI will check your Sourcebook and previous chapters).

### Editing and Feedback

Want a second opinion?
_Example:_ "Read the last three paragraphs I wrote. Is the dialogue natural? How can I make the tension higher?"

## AI Actions

The AI isn't just a chatbot; it can take actions within your project. You can ask it to:

- "Create a new character profile for a grumpy bartender named Moe."
- "Summarize Chapter 1 and update the Story Summary."
- "Generate an image of the Crystal Castle based on my Sourcebook description."
