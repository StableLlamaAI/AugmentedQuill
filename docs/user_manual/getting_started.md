# Getting Started with AugmentedQuill

AugmentedQuill is designed to be a seamless extension of your creative process. It combines a traditional writing environment with powerful AI tools that understand your story's context.

## Core Concepts

Before diving in, it's helpful to understand how AugmentedQuill organizes your work:

- **Projects**: A project is the container for your entire book or story. It holds everything related to that specific work.
- **Story**: The overarching metadata of your project, including the title, synopsis, genre, and themes.
- **Chapters**: The actual prose of your story, broken down into manageable sections.
- **Sourcebook**: Your story's encyclopedia. This is where you keep track of characters, locations, lore, items, and other important details. The AI uses this to stay consistent.
- **Chat Assistant**: Your AI co-writer. You can brainstorm, ask for suggestions, or have it generate text based on your instructions and the context of your story.

## The Main Interface

When you open AugmentedQuill, you'll be greeted by the main dashboard. The interface is divided into three main areas:

1. **Left Sidebar**: This is your project's control center. It contains:
   - **Story Metadata**: Where you define the Title, Summary, Tags, Notes, and Conflicts.
   - **Chapters**: A list of all the chapters in your story.
   - **Sourcebook**: Your story's encyclopedia for characters, locations, and lore.
2. **Main Area (The Editor)**: The central, distraction-free zone where you write your prose.
3. **Right Sidebar (Chat Assistant)**: Your AI co-writer, ready to brainstorm, edit, or generate content.
