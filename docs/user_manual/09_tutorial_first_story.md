# Tutorial: Writing Your First Story

Welcome to the tutorial! In this guide, we won't just look at which buttons to click; we'll walk through the actual process of crafting a compelling story using AugmentedQuill. We will also show you how to perform each step manually or by using the AI Chat Assistant.

## Step 1: The Spark of an Idea

Every story starts with a concept. Before you write a single word of prose, you need to know what your story is about.

**Manually:**

1. Open AugmentedQuill and click the <img src="assets/settings.svg" alt="Settings icon" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" /> **Settings** icon in the top navigation bar.
2. In the **Projects** tab, click **New Project**. Name it "The Lost Heirloom".
3. Close the Settings dialog. In the left sidebar, find the **Story Metadata** section.

**Using Chat:**

1. Open the **[AI Chat Assistant](07_ai_chat_assistant.md)** in the right sidebar.
2. Type: _"Create a new project called 'The Lost Heirloom'."_

### Writing Advice: The Core Conflict

A story without conflict is just a sequence of events. Conflict is the engine that drives the narrative forward. It can be internal (a character battling their own fears) or external (a character battling a villain or nature).

**Manually:**
In the **Story Metadata** section, write a brief summary that highlights the conflict.
_Example:_ "Elara, a cautious librarian, discovers a map to a lost family heirloom. She must overcome her fear of the outside world and race against a ruthless treasure hunter to find it before it falls into the wrong hands."

**Using Chat:**
Type: _"Update the story summary to: Elara, a cautious librarian, discovers a map to a lost family heirloom. She must overcome her fear of the outside world and race against a ruthless treasure hunter to find it before it falls into the wrong hands."_

## Step 2: Populating the World

Before writing, it helps to know who is in the story and where it takes place.

**Manually:**

1. Navigate to the **[Sourcebook](05_sourcebook.md)** in the left sidebar.
2. Create a **Character** entry for your protagonist (e.g., Elara). Fill in her physical description, but more importantly, her _motivations_ and _flaws_.
3. Create a **Character** entry for your antagonist.
4. Create a **Location** entry for the starting point of your story (e.g., The Grand Library).

**Using Chat:**

1. Type: _"Create a character profile in the Sourcebook for Elara. She is a cautious librarian who is secretly brave but afraid of the outside world."_
2. Type: _"Create a character profile for the antagonist, a ruthless treasure hunter named Silas."_
3. Type: _"Create a location entry for The Grand Library, an ancient building filled with dusty tomes and hidden secrets."_

## Step 3: Outlining with the AI

If you aren't sure how to get from the beginning to the end, the AI can help.

1. Open the **[AI Chat Assistant](07_ai_chat_assistant.md)**.
2. Type: _"I have a story about a librarian named Elara looking for a lost heirloom. Can you help me outline the first three chapters? Keep in mind she is very cautious."_
3. The AI will generate an outline. You can ask it to tweak things: _"Make Chapter 2 more action-packed."_

## Step 4: Writing the First Chapter

Now it's time to write.

**Manually:**

1. Go to the **[Chapters](04_chapters_and_books.md)** panel in the left sidebar and click **Add Chapter**. Name it "Chapter 1".
2. Select the chapter to open it in the Editor.

**Using Chat:**

1. Type: _"Create a new chapter called 'Chapter 1'."_

### Writing Advice: Start with Action or Intrigue

Don't start with a long description of the weather or the character's morning routine. Start at a moment of change.

_Example:_ Instead of "Elara woke up and went to work," start with "The ancient book practically burned Elara's fingers as she pulled it from the restricted section."

3. Start writing your scene in the Editor.

## Step 5: Using AI to Enhance Your Prose

As you write, you might hit a wall. Let's say you need to describe the antagonist entering the library, but you can't find the right words.

**Using the Chapter AI:**

1. Click the **Rewrite** (<img src="assets/file-pen.svg" alt="File Edit icon" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" />) button in the header to have the AI regenerate the entire chapter body with better prose. This is a great "reset" option early in the writing process.
2. To extend the chapter with a new scene, click **Extend** (<img src="assets/wand.svg" alt="Wand icon" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" />) and the AI will continue writing from where you left off.
3. For smaller suggestions at the paragraph level, click **Suggest next paragraph** at the bottom of the editor.<br><br>The suggestion cards appear — click any card to insert that text, or press `Escape` to dismiss.

**Using Chat:**

1. Open the **[AI Chat Assistant](07_ai_chat_assistant.md)** in the right sidebar.
2. Type: _"I just wrote 'The bad guy walked in and looked mean.' Can you rewrite this to be more intimidating and descriptive? Remember he is a ruthless treasure hunter named Silas."_
3. Copy the AI's response and paste it into the Editor.

## Step 5b: Adding Visual References

Visual references help both you and the AI stay consistent with how characters and places look.

1. Click the <img src="assets/eye.svg" alt="Image icon" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" /> **Images** icon in the header to open the [Project Images](06_project_images.md) dialog.
2. Click **Create Placeholder** and name it "Elara — character portrait".
3. Fill in the **Description** field with a text description: "A cautious young librarian with dark eyes, ink-stained fingers, and reading glasses perched on her nose."
4. Click **Create prompt** (<img src="assets/sparkles.svg" alt="Sparkles icon" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" />) to have the AI generate an image-generation prompt you can use in an external art tool.
5. Once you have the actual image, click **Replace** on the placeholder card to upload it.
6. Open the Elara entry in the Sourcebook and click **Manage Images** to link the portrait to her character profile.

## Step 6: Pacing and Review

Once you finish the chapter, it's time to review.

### Writing Advice: Pacing

Pacing is how fast or slow the story feels. Action scenes should have shorter sentences and paragraphs to feel fast. Emotional or descriptive scenes can be longer and more flowing.

1. Open the **AI Chat Assistant**.
2. Type: _"Please review Chapter 1. How is the pacing? Is the conflict clear?"_
3. The AI will analyze your text and provide constructive feedback.

## Step 7: Set Up Your Writing Environment

Before your next long writing session, take a moment to tune the appearance to your preferences.

1. Click the <img src="assets/type.svg" alt="Type icon" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" /> **Appearance** button in the header.
2. Try **Mixed** or **Dark** design mode if you prefer less eye strain.
3. Adjust **Font Size** and **Line Width** until the page feels comfortable for a long session.
4. See [Appearance and Display](08_appearance_and_display.md) for all available settings.
