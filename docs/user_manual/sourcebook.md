# The Sourcebook

The Sourcebook is your story's encyclopedia. It is crucial for keeping both you and the AI consistent. When you ask the AI to generate text or brainstorm, it references the Sourcebook to ensure it uses the right names, places, and rules of your world.

## Sourcebook Browser

- **Add entry**: The <img src="assets/plus.svg" alt="Plus icon" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" /> plus button in the header opens the entry dialog so you can create a brand-new record.
- **Search & filter**: The input at the top filters by name, category, or synonym, letting you quickly drill down to the right entry.
- **Hover previews**: Hover an entry to open a tooltip that shows the category badge, description, and the primary associated image (if any) so you can scan details without opening the editor.
- **Click to edit**: Clicking an entry immediately opens it in the editor modal with every field populated.

## Categories & Icons

Every entry belongs to one of the stocked categories (Character, Location, Organization, Item, Event, Lore, Other) and each category shows a relevant Lucide icon (person for characters, map pin for locations, package for items, etc.). The category selector in the editor also displays a short description of what belongs there, helping you keep your taxonomy tidy.

## Entry Dialog / Editor

The dialog that surfaces when you create or edit an entry exposes:

- **Name**: Text field with an icon hint where you give the canonical label (e.g., "Captain Ahab").
- **Category selector**: A grid of buttons with icons, labels, and hover descriptions. Selecting a category highlights it with a brand-colored background and a subtle ring.
- **Synonyms & nicknames**: Chips represent existing synonyms; tap the X to remove one or use the inline field to add more and hit Enter. This is what the search bar matches, so synonyms keep your entries discoverable.
- **Associated images**: The panel shows currently attached images. The "Manage Images" button opens the image picker modal so you can toggle project images on or off, even for placeholder art, and see how many are selected at a glance.
- **Description & facts**: A large textarea accepts the story details you want the AI to reference—history, personality, rules, or quirks. It supports longer, multiline notes and resizes vertically.
- **Save / cancel / delete**: The footer always exposes Save (disabled until the name is non-empty) and Cancel buttons, plus a Delete button when editing an existing entry. Deletion asks for confirmation before firing.

## Image Picker

When you open the image picker you see a fullscreen modal with every project image laid out in a responsive grid. Click an image to select or deselect it; selected images show a checkmark overlay and a brand-tinted ring. Use the Done button to close the picker and persist your choices.

## Why it Matters

The Sourcebook keeps every collaborator and AI call referring to the same canonical lore. Updating descriptions, pulling in new visuals, or reorganizing categories here means every writing session and AI prompt stays on-model.
