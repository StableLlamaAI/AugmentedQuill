# The Sourcebook

The Sourcebook is your story's encyclopedia. It is crucial for keeping both you and the AI consistent. When you ask the AI to generate text or brainstorm, it references the Sourcebook to ensure it uses the right names, places, and rules of your world.

## Categories

You can organize your Sourcebook entries into different categories:

### Characters

Keep track of your cast.

- **Name & Aliases**
- **Physical Description**
- **Personality & Motivations**
- **Backstory**

### Locations

Describe the settings of your story.

- **Name**
- **Atmosphere & Senses**
- **History & Significance**

### Lore & Items

Document the rules of your world, magic systems, important artifacts, or historical events.

## Why the Sourcebook Matters

The more detailed your Sourcebook, the better the AI can assist you. If you tell the AI to "write a scene where John visits the Old Tavern," it will look up "John" and "Old Tavern" in the Sourcebook to ensure it describes them accurately according to your vision.
