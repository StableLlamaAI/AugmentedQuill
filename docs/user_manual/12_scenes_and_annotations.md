# Scenes, Annotations, and Structural Improvements

> **Introduced in:** v0.9+

This chapter covers the major new features: the **Scenes** system (for planning and structuring stories at the narrative-unit level), **inline Annotations** (for notes attached to specific prose), the **Convergence Map** (for time-travel and multi-timeline stories), and various other structural improvements.

## What Are Scenes?

A **Scene** is a narrative unit — a building block of your story that may span part of a chapter, an entire chapter, or remain unlinked from any prose (planning-only). Scenes allow you to:

- Plan your story's structure **before writing** any prose.
- Track **causal relationships** between story events (what causes what).
- Attach **sourcebook characters** to each scene.
- Assign **temporal** (date/time) and **location** metadata.
- Organize scenes into **timelines** for time-travel or parallel narratives.
- Visualize your story through multiple lenses: narrative order, free-form pinboard, or a convergence map with character arc snakes.

### Narrative Units vs. Prose

A scene is a **planning unit**, not a prose unit. Multiple scenes can exist within a single chapter, a scene can span multiple chapters, or a scene can exist purely as a plan without any prose attached. This separation lets you outline your story's structure independently of your actual writing.

## Workspace Modes

Click the **workspace mode buttons** in the top header bar to switch between layouts:

| Mode       | Icon       | What you see                                                 |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Page**   | `FileText` | Traditional editor + left sidebar + right chat panel         |
| **Scenes** | `BookOpen` | Editor is replaced by the full Scenes panel                  |
| **Split**  | `Columns`  | Editor on the left, Scenes panel on the right — side by side |

---

## The Scenes Views

Once you're in **Scenes** or **Split** mode, use the segmented buttons labelled **Pinboard**, **Narrative**, **Chronological**, and **Convergence Map** to switch between view types.

![The Scenes workspace in Narrative view, with scene cards grouped under their chapters and causal links](screenshots/12_scenes_narrative.png)

> **In this screenshot:** the Scenes workspace in **Narrative** view. The view-mode buttons sit in the toolbar at the top, scene cards are grouped under their chapters, and arrows show which scenes cause which.

### Narrative View

The **Narrative View** (default) displays all scenes as a vertical list. Divider lines appear at chapter and book boundaries so you can see how scenes map onto your story structure.

- Scenes without any linked prose are collected at the bottom.
- **Click** any scene card to select it and highlight its prose in the editor.
- **Drag and drop** a scene card to reorder it (this adjusts the causal relationships).
- Multi-select: **Ctrl+click** to toggle individual scenes, **Shift+click** for range selection.

### Pinboard View

The **Pinboard View** provides an infinite canvas where you can freely position scene cards.

![The Scenes workspace in Pinboard view, with freely positioned scene cards linked by causal arrows](screenshots/12_scenes_pinboard.png)

> **In this screenshot:** the **Pinboard** — cards are placed freely on the canvas and linked with causal arrows. Alt+drag from one card toward another draws a new arrow.

- **Pan:** Middle-mouse button drag, or **Alt+drag** on the background.
- **Zoom:** Scroll wheel.
- **Move cards:** Drag any card to reposition it.
- **Multi-card drag:** Drag one selected card to move all selected cards together.
- **Link scenes:** **Alt+drag** from one card toward another to draw a causal arrow — a ghost arrow preview appears as you drag.
- **Lasso select:** Drag on empty space to draw a selection rectangle.
- Same multi-select shortcuts as Narrative View (**Ctrl+click**, **Shift+click**).

### Chronological View

The **Chronological** view sorts every scene by its **in-story time** (the _Scene Time_ you set in the Scene Editor) rather than by narrative order. This is the fastest way to spot pacing problems, timeline conflicts, or scenes that are dated incorrectly.

![The Scenes workspace in Chronological view, sorting scenes by their in-story time](screenshots/12_scenes_chronological.png)

> **In this screenshot:** the **Chronological** view — the same cards as the Narrative view, re-sorted by when each scene happens in the story, with scenes that share a time slot grouped together.

### Convergence Map

The **Convergence Map** is designed for **time-travel stories**. It shows scenes sorted by their in-story time, with one coloured snake path per sourcebook character drawn behind the cards.

![The Convergence Map, with character lanes and snake paths tracing each character through the timeline](screenshots/12_scenes_convergence.png)

> **In this screenshot:** the **Convergence Map**. Each character gets a coloured lane with a snake path that traces how they move through the story's timeline. When a character travels in time, the path doubles back as a U-turn.

- Each character or sourcebook entry gets its own **coloured lane** at the top.
- The snake shows the character's **experience order** through the story.
- Time-travel jumps appear as **U-turns** in the snake path.
- Scene cards are positioned by chronological story time, not narrative order.
- Click a character's lane button to highlight their path.

### A Time-Travel Story in Practice

The Convergence Map really earns its keep when your story jumps through time. The map below is the same view rendered for a series built as **one book per movie** of the _Back to the Future_ trilogy — 22 scenes spanning 1885, 1955, 1985 and 2015, covering all 14 time-travel events:

![The Convergence Map for a time-travel story, with snake paths that double back when characters jump through time](screenshots/12_scenes_convergence_bttf.png)

> **In this screenshot:** the scenes are laid out chronologically, from 1885 at the top to 2015 at the bottom — but the characters experience them in a different order. Every time a character jumps to a scene that happened _earlier_, their snake doubles back in a **U-turn**. Marty's and Doc's snakes cross themselves again and again as the trilogy rewrites its own history.

Scenes from the same movie share one **colour tag** (blue for Part I, orange for Part II, green for Part III), so even though the map is sorted purely by in-story time you can still tell at a glance which movie each scene belongs to.

Every time-travel event is also stored as a **Time Travel** sourcebook entry, and that is what draws the **timeline panel** on the left. Each complete event (one with both an origin and a destination) gets its own **arrow** in its own **swimlane** — one swimlane per timeline OR per time jump, never two things drawn over each other — and every event that opens a new branch is connected to the timeline it starts off with a **spawn line**: a short horizontal connector followed by a rounded knee down into the new lane, like a directory tree. An entry with incomplete data (no destination) draws **no arrow** — the panel only draws a jump when both endpoints are known, and its arrow head always lines up vertically with the scene that marks the arrival (or points at empty space when no scene covers that moment).

`main` is **only the original 1985** — the timeline of the very first scenes. Once a character changes the past, every later scene lives on an altered line. The rule is simple: **a time travel to the past always opens a new branch; a time travel to the future stays on the same line.** In the trilogy that means: Marty's trip to 1955, Old Biff's trip to 1955, Doc's return from 2015 to warn, the trip to the alternate 1985, the return to 1955 that fixes it, and the two trips to 1885 all open branches — while every return to 1985 or trip to 2015 stays on the line the traveller was on (the returns loop back to their own line with a short horizontal segment). Every arrow **starts at the scene dot it departs from** — on the very timeline that scene lives on — so an arrow is never drawn on one timeline while its scene marker sits on another; it then runs in its own swimlane and joins the line it lands on. Each branch starts off a timeline that exists at the moment it branches: Old Biff's 1955 and the restored 1955 split off the first 1955 line, the alternate 1985 branches off Old Biff's 1955, Marty's 1885 opens a second Old West line off Doc's 1885, and the first 1955 and Doc's 1885 fall back to `main` (their direct departure timeline — 2015, the alternate 1985 — does not exist at the branch's creation moment). This keeps the tree connected and no lane ever appears to start from nothing. (Doc's 10:28 a.m. return to warn is the one branch with no scenes on it — a past travel that must fork, but one that lands at the very end of the story.)

### How to Specify Time Travel in Your Scenes

The Convergence Map has no special "time travel" flag — it reads three ordinary scene properties and infers the jumps from them:

1. **Set a precise Scene Time on every scene.** The map sorts scenes by their [Scene Time](#scene-properties), _not_ by narrative order or by which book they belong to. A scene in Book 2 can land chronologically before a scene in Book 1 — that mismatch is exactly what draws the U-turn. Use the clock button in the Scene Editor to set an exact date and time (e.g. `1955-11-12T22:04Z`).
2. **Tag the time-travelling characters.** Put each character who is present in the scene's **Active** or **Passive** characters. The map draws one snake per tagged character, visiting their scenes in _experience_ order (the order the story shows them). When a character's next scene is earlier on the timeline than their previous one, the snake turns back.
3. **Put branch timelines on their own `timeline_id`.** Scenes in an alternate reality or a separate branch (e.g. an alternate 1985) should use a `timeline_id` other than `main`. The left-hand timeline panel groups branches separately so alternate-reality scenes don't tangle with the main timeline.
4. **Use colour tags to group scenes by story arc.** Setting the same **Colour Tag** on every scene of a movie, volume or act makes a chronologically sorted view readable: readers can immediately tell which scenes belong together even when they're scattered across the timeline.
5. **Model each time jump as a Time Travel sourcebook entry.** For every jump in your story, add a **Time Travel** category entry in the Sourcebook: set the departure time as **Origin Date**, the arrival time as **Destination Date/Time**, and tick **Creates New Timeline** whenever the jump opens a new branch. The left-hand timeline panel draws one **arrow** per entry and connects every new branch to the timeline it left with a **spawn arc**. Name each entry (e.g. `1985 -> 1955`), set the scenes that land on the branch to `timeline_id = branch:<entry name>` (the sourcebook auto-fills this), and add the entry to the **departure scene's** sourcebook tags so the arrow starts at a real scene dot.

For characters who travel as individuals — including a time traveller meeting their younger self in the same scene — see [Per-Scene Personal Datetime Overrides](#per-scene-personal-datetime-overrides) and the [Sourcebook Time Travel Features](#sourcebook-time-travel-features).

## Creating and Managing Scenes

### Creating a Scene

You can create scenes in several ways:

1. **AI Chat:** Ask the assistant to create a new scene (e.g., _"Create a new scene where Elena meets the stranger."_)
2. **Detect Boundaries:** Ask the AI to analyse your existing prose and **automatically detect scene boundaries**, creating linked scenes from the result.
3. **Write a Scene:** Ask the AI to write prose for a specific scene, optionally within a particular chapter.

### Scene Properties

Each scene card displays key information. You can edit all properties in the Scene Editor Dialog.

| Property               | Description                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Summary**            | A one-line description of what happens in the scene.                                                                   |
| **Status**             | One of: Active, Draft, Completed, Paused, or Cut.                                                                      |
| **Location**           | Where the scene takes place (free text).                                                                               |
| **Time / Scene Time**  | When the scene takes place (date and time).                                                                            |
| **Timeline**           | Which timeline this scene belongs to. Default is "main"; for time-travel branches, you can create custom timeline IDs. |
| **Color Tag**          | A coloured border for visual organization — choose from red, orange, yellow, green, teal, blue, purple, or pink.       |
| **Active Characters**  | Characters who are present and active in the scene.                                                                    |
| **Passive Characters** | Characters who are present but not directly acting.                                                                    |
| **Causes**             | Which other scenes this one is caused by (determines narrative order).                                                 |

### Causal Ordering

Scenes are ordered by their **causal relationships**, not by arbitrary numbers. Each scene lists what it depends on, forming a cause-and-effect chain.

- The system automatically detects **ordering violations** — scenes that should logically come before the scenes that cause them — and shows an **`AlertTriangle` icon** on the card.
- **Temporal violations** are also flagged: if a scene's time is _before_ the scene that causes it, you'll see a **`Clock3` icon**.

### Scene Beats

Each scene can contain **Beats** — smaller sub-units of action within the scene. Beats help you break down a scene into its key moments (e.g., "Elena arrives", "The argument begins", "The stranger leaves") and can each link to their own section of prose.

---

## The Scene Editor Dialog

**Double-click** any scene card, or ask the AI to edit a scene, to open the **Scene Editor Dialog**. This provides a full form where you can:

![Scene Editor Dialog with summary, beats, characters, time, location, and color tag](screenshots/12_scene_editor.png)

> **In this screenshot:** the **Scene Editor** for one scene — summary, beats, active/passive characters, scene time, location, color tag, and causal links, all in a single form.

- Edit the **summary**, **location**, **time**, and **status**.
- Manage **Active** and **Passive character** lists.
- Assign a **color tag** for visual organization.
- Adjust the **pinboard position** (X/Y coordinates).
- View and edit **causal relationships** (which scenes this one follows or precedes).
- Set a **date/time** value by clicking the clock button to open the date/time picker.

---

## Inline Annotations

**Annotations** let you attach notes, comments, or reminders to specific ranges of text. They appear as coloured highlights in the editor.

![The editor showing inline annotation highlights with the Annotation panel listing them on the right](screenshots/12_annotations_editor.png)

> **In this screenshot:** two inline annotations highlighted in the prose, with the **Annotation panel** open on the right listing each comment. Click an entry to jump to its highlight in the text.

### Adding an Annotation

1. **Select** the text you want to annotate in the editor.
2. Press **Ctrl+Shift+A** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd+Shift+A** (macOS) — or click the **`MessageSquare` icon** in the editor toolbar.
3. Type your comment in the dialog and confirm.

### Managing Annotations

Open the **Annotation Sidebar** (click the **`MessageSquarePlus` icon** in the right-side panel area). It lists all annotations for the current chapter:

- **Click** an annotation entry to scroll the editor to it and highlight the annotated range.
- Use the **`Pencil` icon** to edit a comment.
- Use the **`Trash2` icon** to delete an annotation.
- The list refreshes automatically when you switch chapters.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut                           | Action                             |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Ctrl+Shift+A** / **Cmd+Shift+A** | Create annotation on selected text |
| **Escape**                         | Close the annotation dialog        |

---

## Scene Sourcebook Tags

Characters and sourcebook entries can now carry a **birth or origin date**. When you attach such an entry to a scene, the system can display the character's **age** at the time of the scene, computed from their origin date and the scene's time.

### Per-Scene Personal Datetime Overrides

For time-travel stories, each character tag on a scene can optionally override the character's personal "now" for that specific scene. This allows the same character to appear multiple times in one scene (e.g., a time traveller meeting their younger self) — each instance can show a different age.

---

## Sidebar Enhancements

The left sidebar (containing Story, Chapters, and Sourcebook sections) received several improvements:

- **Resizable sections** — Drag the grip lines between sections to resize them.
- **Section focus** — Click the expand icon in a section's header to focus that section (it expands fully, collapsing others). Click the collapse icon to return to the multi-section view.
- **Scene tree in chapters** — Expand a chapter node to see its assigned scenes listed underneath in a compact tree view, using the expand/collapse arrows to toggle chapters.
- **Drag scenes onto chapters** — Drag a scene card from the scenes panel and drop it onto a chapter in the sidebar to link them.
- **Desktop behaviour** — On wide screens, selecting a chapter no longer closes the sidebar.

---

## Search and Replace in Scenes

The Search & Replace system (accessible via the AI chat or the search panel) can now search inside scene metadata:

- **Scene summaries** — Find and replace text in scene descriptions.
- **Scene locations** — Search or replace location names across all scenes.
- **Scene times** — Find temporal values.
- **Timeline IDs** — Search timeline identifiers.
- **Character lists** — Find or replace character names in active/passive lists.

---

## AI Chat Integration

### Scene Chat Tools

The AI assistant can help you manage scenes conversationally. Just ask in natural language:

> _"Create a new scene where Elena discovers the hidden letter."_
>
> _"List all scenes involving Marcus."_
>
> _"Move the market scene after the forest scene."_
>
> _"Write the prose for scene 5 inside chapter 3."_
>
> _"Detect scene boundaries in my current chapter."_

New tools available to the assistant include:

| What you can ask for | What the AI does                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Create a scene       | Adds a new scene with summary, location, and characters |
| Update a scene       | Changes summary, time, location, status, etc.           |
| Delete a scene       | Removes a scene and its markers from prose              |
| List scenes          | Shows all scenes with their summaries and status        |
| Get scene details    | Shows all properties of a single scene                  |
| Reorder scenes       | Adjusts causal relationships to change narrative order  |
| Link scene to prose  | Attaches a scene to a specific content scope            |
| Write scene prose    | Generates prose content for a scene via the Writing LLM |
| Detect boundaries    | Analyses existing prose and auto-creates linked scenes  |

### Project Creation Confirmation

When the AI creates a new project, you'll be asked to **confirm** if the project name wasn't specified upfront.

### Chat Session Preservation

When you switch to a different project, your current chat session is automatically saved and associated with that project. When you return, the conversation picks up where you left off.

### Context Usage Display

The chat header now shows two context usage meters: your local estimation and the **server-reported usage** (as a percentage of the model's context window), so you know how close you are to the model's token limit.

---

## Diff Review Improvements

When the editor shows highlighted changes (e.g., after an AI rewrite or undo), several new tools help you review and accept or reject changes.

### Floating Accept/Reject Toolbar

Hover over any diff-highlighted section in the editor — a small toolbar appears with:

- **`Check` icon** — Accept this individual change
- **`X` icon** — Reject this change (revert to the original)
- **`CheckCheck` icon** — Accept all changes (shown when multiple diffs exist)

### Block Mode for Large Rewrites

When the AI substantially rewrites a section, the diff switches to **block mode**: the old and new versions are shown side by side as whole blocks, making it easier to review large changes compared to word-level inline highlighting.

---

## Sourcebook Time Travel Features

Sourcebook entries now support a **Time Travel** category with additional fields for managing temporal stories.

### New Sourcebook Fields

When editing a sourcebook entry of the "Time Travel" category, you'll see these additional fields:

| Field                      | What it's for                                                                        |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Origin Date**            | Birth or creation date of the entry — used to compute a character's age at any scene |
| **Destination Date/Time**  | For time-travel entries: the absolute date/time the character travels to             |
| **Destination (Relative)** | A relative description (e.g., "1000 years in the past")                              |
| **Creates New Timeline**   | Check this if the entry creates a branching timeline                                 |
| **Timeline ID**            | A stable identifier for this timeline (auto-filled for branches)                     |

### Relation Scoping to Scenes

## Sourcebook relations are now scoped to individual **scenes** instead of whole chapters. When you define a relationship between entries (e.g., "Elena knows Marcus"), you can specify which scene the relationship starts and ends at, giving you finer control over relationship timelines.
