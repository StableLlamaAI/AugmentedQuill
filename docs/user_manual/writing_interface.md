# The Writing Interface

The main column of AugmentedQuill is your prose studio. It shows the active chapter (title plus editable body), hosts the AI buttons that extend or rewrite the draft, and keeps suggestions, uploads, and formatting controls just within reach. The chapter and book management UI lives in the sidebar, which is described in [Chapters and Books](chapters_and_books.md).

## Editor Workspace

The editor is a flexible canvas: when the view mode is **WYSIWYG**, the prose renders like a word processor; when it is **Markdown** or **Raw**, you edit the UTF-8 markdown directly. `PlainTextEditable` components keep the same typography, line height, and focus behavior across both modes while `settings.maxWidth` caps the line length for long-form comfort. Drag-and-drop image uploads, background color themes, and sanitizing key handlers (Arrow keys, Enter, Ctrl/Cmd shortcuts) work the same regardless of mode, so you can switch freely while the LLM context follows your cursor.

## Top Bar Controls

The condensed bar above the editor holds view toggles, formatting helpers, AI buttons, and the WRITING/EDITING/CHAT model selectors. On desktop the buttons are exposed; smaller screens wrap the view and formatting controls inside expandable menus so the same commands stay within reach.

### View and Whitespace

From left to right, you can pick between `Raw` (<img src="assets/file-text.svg" alt="File Text icon" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" /> File Text), `MD` (<img src="assets/code.svg" alt="Code icon" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" /> Code), and `Visual` (<img src="assets/eye.svg" alt="Eye icon" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" /> Eye) modes or toggle whitespace visibility with the <img src="assets/pilcrow.svg" alt="Pilcrow icon" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" /> Pilcrow `WS`. On mobile and tablets these options share a single View menu (the <img src="assets/chevron-down.svg" alt="Chevron Down icon" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" /> ChevronDown icon shows the current mode) so you can still pick any mode without crowding the header.

### Formatting Tools

Next along the bar are the text-formatting shortcuts: Bold, Italic, and Link are always visible, while heading (H1–H3), Blockquote, and List helpers show up on larger breakpoints and inside the mobile Format menu (<img src="assets/type.svg" alt="Type icon" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" /> Type icon + dropdown). Buttons highlight when the style is active, providing instant feedback about the current selection.

### AI Actions and Models

The Chapter AI badge on the right mirrors the floating toolbar: Extend (<img src="assets/wand.svg" alt="Wand icon" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" /> Wand icon) and Rewrite (<img src="assets/file-pen.svg" alt="File Edit icon" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" /> File Edit icon) both call the Violet WRITING model (same colors referenced in the machine settings guide). Beyond the action buttons are the Writing, Editing, and Chat model selectors—they display the provider color (Violet, Fuchsia, Blue), report connection health, and let you swap LLMs in the WRITING → EDITING → CHAT order enforced throughout the UI.

## AI Writing Tools (WRITING Model)

All three writing-focused actions — Extend, Rewrite, and Suggest — use the **WRITING** model (<img src="assets/book-open.svg" alt="Book Open icon" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" /> Book Open, <img src="assets/swatches/violet.svg" alt="Violet swatch" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" /> Violet) explained in the machine settings guide. The action buttons live in the floating toolbar and the persistent footer, so they are always available even as you scroll.

### Extend Chapter

At the top of the editor is the `Chapter AI` badge. The first button is `Extend` with the <img src="assets/wand.svg" alt="Wand icon" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" /> Wand icon. Clicking it asks the WRITING model to continue from the end of the current chapter, injecting new prose while keeping existing formatting and style tags intact. The button is disabled while the model is processing, and a spinner appears until the new text is appended.

### Rewrite Chapter

Next to Extend is `Rewrite`, decorated with the <img src="assets/file-pen.svg" alt="File Edit icon" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" /> File Edit icon. Unlike a simple grammar pass, Rewrite asks the WRITING model to re-generate the chapter content entirely (using the same summary and style tags it already knows). This makes it easy to reset the voice or framing of a chapter while retaining the story structure.

### Suggest Next Paragraph

At the bottom of the editor sits the pulsing `Suggest next paragraph` pill with the <img src="assets/sparkles.svg" alt="Sparkles icon" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" /> Sparkles icon. It opens the continuation pane, displaying cards with the <img src="assets/square-split-horizontal.svg" alt="Split Square icon" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" /> Split Square icon and brief text generated by the WRITING model. You can click any card to drop its text into your draft or dismiss the entire pane by clicking `Dismiss`. While suggestions are generating, the button shows a spinner plus the word “Working…” to indicate the call is in-flight.

Because suggestions are generated dynamically, every card remains interactive: hover to see focus, and click to accept. They also respect the same keyboard shortcuts handled in `Editor.tsx`: `Ctrl+Enter`/`Cmd+Enter` triggers suggestions, `ArrowLeft`/`ArrowRight` cycles options, `ArrowDown` requests a regeneration, `ArrowUp` undoes the last suggestion, and `Escape` closes the pane.

## Summary AI Controls (EDITING Model)

The summary tab inside the metadata dialog (covered in [Chapters and Books](chapters_and_books.md)) exposes `AI Write`, `AI Update`, and `AI Rewrite` buttons. They use the <img src="assets/pen.svg" alt="Pen icon" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" /> Fuchsia **EDITING** model <img src="assets/swatches/fuchsia.svg" alt="Fuchsia swatch" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" /> to craft concise descriptions, tweak tone, or polish the storytelling focus without touching the chapter body.

## Keyboard and Flow Tips

- `Ctrl+Enter`/`Cmd+Enter` is the quickest way to open suggestions; you never have to reach for the mouse.
- The suggestion pane always shows the last `continuations` array, so you can keep requesting more or hit `Dismiss` once you are satisfied.
- Even when AI actions are running, you can keep typing because the UI disables only the relevant button and leaves the rest of the editor responsive.
