# The Writing Interface

The heart of AugmentedQuill is the writing interface, where you'll spend most of your time crafting your prose.

## Story Metadata

In the left sidebar, you'll find the **Story Metadata** section. This is where you define the big picture of your narrative.

Here you can fill in:

- **Title**: The name of your story.
- **Summary**: A brief summary of what the story is about. The AI uses this to understand the core plot.
- **Tags**: Genre and style tags to help the AI tailor its tone.
- **Notes & Private Notes**: Any additional information you want to keep track of.
- **Conflicts**: The core conflicts driving your narrative.

## Managing Chapters

Below the Story Metadata, your story is divided into chapters. You can view and manage them in the Chapters panel.

- **Add Chapter**: Create a new blank chapter.
- **Reorder**: Drag and drop chapters to change their sequence.

## The Editor

When you select a chapter, it opens in the Editor in the main area. This is a distraction-free zone for writing.

The editor allows you to write naturally. But because this is AugmentedQuill, you have AI assistance at your fingertips.

### AI Integration in the Editor

While writing, you can highlight text and ask the AI to perform actions. The application uses color hints to show which AI model is being used:

- **Rewrite (Fuchsia)**: Change the tone, expand, or condense the selected text. This uses the **EDITING** model.
- **Continue (Violet)**: Have the AI write the next few paragraphs based on what you've already written. This uses the **WRITING** model.
- **Critique (Fuchsia)**: Get feedback on pacing, dialogue, or description. This uses the **EDITING** model.
