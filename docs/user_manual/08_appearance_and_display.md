# Appearance and Display

AugmentedQuill gives you fine-grained control over how the writing environment looks and feels. The **Appearance popup** lets you adjust the visual theme, typography, and panel sizes. The **Debug Logs** overlay (for advanced users) lets you inspect every AI request your session has made.

## Appearance Popup

Click the <img src="assets/type.svg" alt="Type icon" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" /> **Appearance** button (the "Aa" / Type icon) on the right side of the top header bar and a dropdown panel appears below it.

### Design Mode

A three-segment toggle at the top of the popup controls the overall color theme:

| Option    | Description                                                                                                                                      |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Light** | The editor paper is bright white and all panels use a light color scheme. Best for daylight or well-lit rooms.                                   |
| **Mixed** | The editor paper stays light but the surrounding panels (sidebar, header, chat pane) use darker tones. A good balance for long writing sessions. |
| **Dark**  | All panels and the editor use dark backgrounds. Best for low-light environments or writers who prefer less screen glare.                         |

The mode takes effect immediately across the entire application.

### Appearance Sliders

Five range sliders below the Design Mode toggle let you tune the reading and writing environment to your preferences. All changes are applied instantly as you drag.

| Slider            | Range                  | Default | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Brightness**    | 50 – 100               | 100     | Controls the brightness of the editor paper area. Lower values create a slightly off-white page that is easier on the eyes during long sessions.                                              |
| **Contrast**      | 50 – 100               | 100     | Controls the contrast of the text against the background. Reducing this slightly can soften harsh black-on-white text.                                                                        |
| **Font Size**     | 12 – 32 px             | 16 px   | Sets the base font size of the editor text. Increase for comfortable reading on large monitors; decrease to see more text at once.                                                            |
| **Line Width**    | 40 – 100 ch            | 70 ch   | Sets the maximum width of the editor column, measured in characters. Narrower lines (50–65 ch) are considered easier to read for long-form prose; wider lines let you see more text per line. |
| **Sidebar Width** | 200 – 600 px (step 10) | 320 px  | Controls the width of the left sidebar (and the right chat panel). Increase this if your project has long chapter titles or many Sourcebook entries that need more horizontal space.          |

### Closing the Popup

Click the **✕** button in the top-right corner of the popup, or click anywhere outside it, to close the Appearance panel. All changes are preserved automatically.

## Debug Logs

The **Debug Logs** dialog is a developer-focused tool that shows a full transcript of every AI request AugmentedQuill has sent during the current session. It is useful for diagnosing unexpected AI behavior, verifying what context is being sent, or comparing request and response data.

Open it by clicking the **Bug** icon on the right side of the top header bar.

### View Modes

The toolbar at the top of the dialog offers two ways to inspect logs:

| Mode           | Icon        | Description                                                                                                                            |
| -------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Aggregated** | Layers icon | Shows each request as a clean summary: the full assembled response text and any tool calls. Best for quickly reading what the AI said. |
| **Chunks**     | List icon   | Shows every raw JSON streaming chunk received from the API. Best for deep debugging of streaming issues or token usage.                |

### Toolbar Actions

| Button                                                                                                                      | Description                                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Refresh** (<img src="assets/edit-2.svg" alt="Refresh icon" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" />) | Re-fetches the log data from the server. Use this if you have been running requests in another browser tab. |
| **Clear** (<img src="assets/trash-2.svg" alt="Trash icon" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" />)    | Deletes all stored log entries after confirmation.                                                          |
| **Close** (✕)                                                                                                               | Closes the dialog.                                                                                          |

### Log Entries

Each entry in the log list is a collapsible row. The collapsed row shows:

- An **HTTP method badge** (POST in green, other methods in blue).
- A **model type badge** indicating which role made the call: EDITING (purple), WRITING (blue), or CHAT (orange).
- The **API endpoint name** (e.g. `/api/v1/chat/completions`).
- The **HTTP status code** (200 in green, errors in red).
- **Start and end timestamps** with elapsed time.

Click a row to expand it. The expanded view shows two collapsible sections:

- **Request**: An interactive JSON tree showing the full payload sent to the model, including the system prompt, user messages, tool definitions, and any image attachments.
- **Response**: An interactive JSON tree showing the raw response (Chunks mode) or the assembled text and tool call results (Aggregated mode).

JSON objects and arrays are collapsible — click the chevron next to any key to expand or collapse that branch. This makes it easy to navigate large payloads without scrolling through thousands of lines.
