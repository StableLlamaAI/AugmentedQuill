# AGENTS.md

Agent operating guide for AugmentedQuill.

This file is intentionally optimized for coding agents: high-signal, executable guidance only.

## 1. Purpose And Scope

- Use this file as the primary agent playbook for this repository.
- Apply these rules for all files unless a more local AGENTS.md exists in a subdirectory.
- Prefer minimal, targeted changes. Avoid repo-wide refactors unless explicitly requested.

## 2. Project Snapshot

- Product: local-first AI writing assistant.
- Backend: FastAPI + Python (`src/augmentedquill`).
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite (`src/frontend`).
- Tests: backend tests in `tests/unit`, frontend tests co-located with features.
- Production serving model: backend serves built frontend from `static/dist`.

## 3. Environment And Setup

### Required versions

- Python >= 3.12 (CI uses 3.12)
- Node >= 24 (CI uses 24)

### Backend setup (repo root)

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Frontend setup

```bash
cd src/frontend
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

## 4. Run Commands

### Dev mode (recommended)

Terminal 1:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
augmentedquill --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 28000
```

Terminal 2:

```bash
cd src/frontend
npm run dev
```

- Vite dev server defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:28001` and proxies backend/static.

### Production-like local run

```bash
cd src/frontend && npm run build
cd ../..
source venv/bin/activate
augmentedquill --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

## 5. Mandatory Validation (Before Finishing)

Run the smallest relevant subset first, then broaden if needed.

### Backend checks

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
ruff check .
black --check .
python -m pytest
```

### Frontend checks

```bash
cd src/frontend
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test
npm run build
```

### Generated API types drift check

```bash
cd src/frontend
npm run check:generated-types
```

## 6. Architecture Boundaries (Do Not Cross)

### Backend

- Keep route handlers in `src/augmentedquill/api/v1` thin.
- Put business logic in `src/augmentedquill/services/<domain>`.
- Use shared response helpers in `src/augmentedquill/api/v1/http_responses.py` where applicable.
- Use project dependency resolution (`ProjectDep`) from `src/augmentedquill/api/v1/dependencies.py` for project-scoped routes.
- Keep all application LLM instructions separated from code and stored in `resources/config/instructions.json` so instruction sets can be project-language specific.

### Frontend

- Keep feature logic in `src/frontend/features/<domain>`.
- Keep reusable UI primitives in `src/frontend/components/ui`.
- Use API facade/client modules in `src/frontend/services`.
- Do not introduce ad-hoc fetch calls in features when an API client exists.

## 7. Style And Conventions

### Required file headers

- Every new/modified `.py`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js` file must include:
  - GPL header
  - Purpose line/docstring style used by the repository

Use:

```bash
python tools/enforce_code_hygiene.py .
python tools/check_copyright.py .
```

### Python

- Formatter/linter: Black + Ruff
- Line length: 88
- Favor typed signatures and small service helpers over oversized route functions.
- Code changes must be professional and solid; avoid shortcuts and temporary hacks.
- Use type annotations for all new/modified Python code (function params, return types, and important variables where needed for clarity).

### TypeScript/React

- Linting via `src/frontend/eslint.config.cjs`
- Key enforced rules include:
  - single quotes
  - no explicit `any`
  - prefer typed parameters
  - accessibility-focused jsx-a11y rules
- Code changes must be professional and solid; avoid shortcuts and temporary hacks.
- Use explicit, precise TypeScript types for all new/modified code; avoid implicit `any` and weakly typed shapes.

### Type design strategy (library-wide vs app-specific)

- Library/shared helper functions should accept reasonably wide, reusable input types where this does not reduce safety.
- Program/application functions should use the strictest minimal types possible to encode concrete invariants.
- Prefer converting from wide boundary types to strict internal types at module boundaries.
- Keep type contracts explicit; do not rely on ambiguous unions when domain types are known.

### Maintainability priorities (highest priority)

- Optimize first for maintainable and compact code.
- Avoid duplication; prefer shared helpers over copy-pasted logic.
- Enforce strict separation of concerns across route/service/model/UI layers.

### i18n and language handling (strict)

- Never hardcode user-facing English strings in UI components.
- Use `react-i18next` translation keys.
- Inputs/textareas that edit story text must set `lang={storyLanguage || 'en'}` (or equivalent) and keep spellcheck behavior correct.
- Never hardcode LLM facing prompts or prompt templates, use `instructions.json` and its infrastructure for project specific language prompts and templates.

## 8. Test Data Safety (Strict)

- Never use real runtime data directories in tests:
  - `data/config`
  - `data/projects`
  - `data/logs`
- Tests must isolate runtime paths via temp environment variables before importing app modules:
  - `AUGQ_USER_DATA_DIR`
  - `AUGQ_PROJECTS_ROOT`
  - `AUGQ_PROJECTS_REGISTRY`
  - `AUGQ_MACHINE_CONFIG_PATH` (when needed)
- Follow `tests/conftest.py` pattern for session-scoped temporary directories.

## 9. Generated Artifacts Rules

- Treat these as generated artifacts and do not hand-edit unless explicitly required:
  - `openapi.json` (from backend export tool)
  - `src/frontend/types/api.generated.ts` (from OpenAPI generation)
- If backend API contracts change, regenerate and validate generated type files.

## 9.5 Project File Schema Evolution Rules

- Changes to project/story files must either be backward compatible or explicitly bump the config/schema version.
- Any version bump must include an automatic conversion function from the prior version.
- Conversions must be chainable step-by-step (for example v2 -> v3 -> v4) so older versions can be upgraded safely through intermediate migrations.
- Never introduce a breaking project-file format change without a tested migration path.

## 10. Security And Operational Guardrails

- App is local-first and not designed for public internet exposure without external access controls.
- Prefer local loopback bindings for development (`127.0.0.1`).
- Be careful with LLM request/response logs and secrets in environment variables.

## 11. Agent Workflow Heuristics

- Read only what is needed for the current task.
- Prefer surgical edits over broad rewrites.
- After edits, run relevant checks and report concrete outcomes.
- If failures are unrelated to your change, report them clearly instead of silently changing unrelated code.
- Preserve existing style and naming in touched files.

## 12. Token Budget Rules (What To Include vs Omit)

Use this section to avoid context waste in future agent updates.

### Keep in AGENTS.md

- Stable, repo-wide commands and constraints.
- Non-obvious pitfalls that frequently cause regressions.
- Hard requirements (test isolation, i18n constraints, generated file rules).
- Architectural boundaries that prevent misplaced code.

### Keep out of AGENTS.md

- Exhaustive file trees and long inventories.
- Full architecture narratives already covered in docs.
- Rare one-off historical incidents.
- Verbose style philosophy not tied to actionable checks.
- Duplicate instructions that are already enforced by tooling, unless the failure cost is high.

## 13. Fast Task Routing

- API endpoint behavior change: edit route in `api/v1`, implement logic in `services/<domain>`, add/update backend tests.
- Frontend feature/UI change: edit `features/<domain>`, keep strings in i18n resources, add/update component tests.
- Config/path behavior: inspect `src/augmentedquill/core/config.py` and corresponding tests in `tests/unit/core`.
- Chat tool change: update tool models/functions under `src/augmentedquill/services/chat/chat_tools` and validate tool schema behavior.

## 14. Definition Of Done For Agent Changes

- Code compiles/lints/tests for the touched area.
- Required generated artifacts updated (if applicable).
- No hardcoded UI strings introduced.
- No real user runtime data touched by tests.
- Diff is minimal and scoped to the request.
